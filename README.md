## Difficulties/Problems Encountered
* I found this to be one of the more difficult challenges.  This was very heavy on MYSQL an back end coding.  The many parts and requirements made it difficult to grasp key concepts.  Joining tables proved to be a difficult concept to grasp.

## Built With
* MYSQL
* NODE.JS
* CONSOLE.TABLE
* DOTENV
* EXPRESS
* INQUIRER
